    PerTenantExtensionCop
    UICop

    VsCode - Settings - ALLanaguage Extension (Enable Code Analysis) there is a n option (bacckround Code Analysis)

- Install develope and deploy for BC
 Install Dev Env 
 AL:GO - Create a projext and configure JSON files
  NEed to know the order of questions:
   1. Name and path where it going to create
   2. Version oif Bsuiness Central
